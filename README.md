# hammond_midi
A MIDI Hammond project using setBfree on a RPI, Arduinos and a Fatar Keyboard TP8O. Hardware (PCBs) and software will be shared here.

The goal of the project is to design a low-cost Hammond Organ B3 MIDI controller. Some commercial alternative exist but they are quite expensive.
I wanted to buy a Fatar Keyboard TP8O (which is what is used for example on Nord Stage NS3), to create all electronics needed to convert its inputs to MIDI and to use a Rapsberry PI B4 to generate the sound. Arduino cards (One Due and 2 micropro 3.3V) are also used on the project.
